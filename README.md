ResNet as the numerical solution of a Stochastic Differential Equation

We consider the ResNet as a numerical solution of a transport equation. We expect that adding diffusion improves stability and therefore robustness against adversarial attacks. Feynman-Kac formula invites us to perform Monte Carlo on a related noisy process to solve the diffusion problem. 

In this repository, we explore deep neural networks simulating the It√¥ process with improved weak orders of convergence.
